# bananas

Bananas is a problem from the 2018 Baldwin Wallace University programming competition.

In the problem, a number of cases, the size of the grid, and the grid of B, A, and Ns are given as input.
The program must find the number of times the word "BANANA" appears in the grid like a word search.
However, the direction of the word can be changed mid-banana. The only rule is that the same letter cannot be used twice (can't cross itself).

This is a solution I made outside of the competition. Although I competed, our team was not able to solve it in time.
